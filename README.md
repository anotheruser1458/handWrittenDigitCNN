# handWrittenDigitCNN
Neural network trained to recognize hand written digits.

## Overview
This is a personal project which involved training a TensorFlow neural network to recognize hand written digits, deploying the model to the cloud, and creating a frontend user interface which allows people to draw their own digits on screen and recieve the model's prediction of what digit it thinks it sees. 

## Model Training
The tfTest folder contains all the code related to training and testing the model. Below are the steps I took to ensure the model worked properly before deploying it to the cloud.
### Training the Model
A TensorFlow sequential model was trained using 70,000 pixel arrays (28x28) which correspond to a 28x28 pixel image of a person's hand written digit. Each array element shows how light or dark a specific pixel is on the 28x28 image, depicted as a value somewhere between 0 and 1.

<strong><em>tfTest/trainModel.py</em></strong>

The training data is split into two randomized sets: a training set of 60,000 arrays and a testing set of 10,000 arrays.
```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Train Model
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist

(X_train, Y_train),(X_test, Y_test) = mnist.load_data()
X_train = tf.keras.utils.normalize(X_train)
X_test = tf.keras.utils.normalize(X_test)
```

The model is initialized using the 'relu' activation function and form fitted to intake the 28x28 flattened pixel array. 
```python
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28,28)))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=128, activation='relu'))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=128, activation='relu'))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=128, activation='relu'))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation=tf.nn.softmax))
```

The model is compiled and fit to the training data and then evaluated with the test data.
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, Y_train, epochs=4)

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, Y_test)
print(accuracy)
```
### Testing Real Images
I drew a digit and resized it to 28x28 using GNU's Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). Using the opencv-python package, the digit image file was read into memory and converted to an np array. The np array is passed to the model and a prediction is made and displayed using pyplot.

<strong><em>tfTest/loadModelTest.py</em></strong>
<br>
Draw an image on any drawing software and save it to the project directory. The digit must be black and must have a white background and resized to 28x28.

Add imports and load the model (loading the model allows you to use it without having to train it again).
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import cv2 as cv
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
model = tf.keras.models.load_model("model")
```
Use opencv to read the image into memory and invert it to have black pixels show white, and white pixels show as black.
```python
image = cv.imread('testData/digit.png')[:, :, 0]
image = np.invert(np.array([image]))
```
The image will now look like this to the computer:

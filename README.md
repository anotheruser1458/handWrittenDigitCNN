# handWrittenDigitCNN
Neural network trained to recognize hand written digits.

## Overview
This is a personal project which involved training a TensorFlow neural network to recognize hand written digits, deploying the model to the cloud, and creating a frontend user interface which allows people to draw their own digits on screen and recieve the model's prediction of what digit it thinks it sees. 

## Model Training
The tfTest folder contains all the code related to training and testing the model. Below are the steps I took to ensure the model worked properly before deploying it to the cloud.
